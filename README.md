# Subdomain-finder
This script simplifies subdomain discovery and validation. Users input a filename and target domain, triggering the 'assetfinder' tool to find associated subdomains. The script checks subdomain status using 'httprobe,' removes duplicates, and provides useful stats like initial and final counts. Designed for cybersecurity, it showcases effective reconnaissance, emphasizing simplicity, stats reporting, and utility for professionals. This tool is used to find the live sub-domains of a target domain.
